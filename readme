Hey Team! This is the code repository for Brand New Game (the development name, you can change it!)

I've heavily notated a lot of the code so everyone can take a look under the hood!
I would start in index.html and follow the code from there, everything else flows down from the index file




### Game Notes:

No cookies can be saved, so all data is "session based" and dissapears when you leave the page

Apples need weight to them so players make riskier moves to collect them, perhaps they can be a score multiplier 
Text when collecting apples: "Score Boost: 10%"
Personal leaderboard that shows your top ten scores for that session


Later:
Global Leaderboard, could have one for each world type
