# Brand-New-Game

Hey Team! This is the code repository for Brand New Game (the development name, you can change it!)

I'm working on heavily notating a lot of the code so everyone can take a look under the hood.
I would start in index.html and follow the code from there, everything else flows down from the index file



### Game Notes:

No cookies can be saved, so all data is "session based" and dissapears when you leave the page

Next:
  Priority: Get mobile version working properly
  Need to clean up all the code
  Allow player to jump slightly before touching the ground
  Need to fix first jump 'no sound' bug
